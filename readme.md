# Gundam Power Ranger Wings!

**Group Members.. Selena and Aaron!**

We made mechanical gundam-inspired wings that are powered by servos! We made a website that allows you to control the wings, and fool the person who's wearing them. The wings are made of out of cardboard, and 3D printed the joints that allow them to move freely.
