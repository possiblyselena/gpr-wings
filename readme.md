We made mechanical gundam-inspired wings that are powered by servos! We made a website that allows you to control the wings, and fool the person who's wearing them. The wings are made of out of cardboard, and 3D printed the joints that allow them to move freely. 

# Inital Ideas 
When thinking of this idea, I thought it would be cool for it to move when it senses motion. I was planning to make a module for the wrist with an accelerometer and 2 wemos minis to communicate with eachother.

We couldn't do the communication between 2 wemos since we struggled with the connection. thankfully someone was able to gift us a esp32 and we use that to control the wings instead. 

When designing the joints, I saw the solder spool at the station downstairs and thought it was the perfect shape to use. I then designed it in onshape and sent 14 to print.

Then it was time to assemble!
